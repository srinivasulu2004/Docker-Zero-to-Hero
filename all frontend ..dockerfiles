Perfect bro 💪 — this is exactly the kind of clarity every **DevOps engineer** should have for frontend projects when writing Dockerfiles!

Let’s go **step-by-step** and cover **all major frontend stacks** — their:

* 🧱 **Base image**
* 📁 **Build path**
* 🧩 **Dependency install command**
* ⚙️ **Build command**
* 🌐 **Serve (with & without Nginx)**

## 🧩 Example 1: React (Vite) — Without Nginx

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 - Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2 - Run (simple Node serve)
EXPOSE 5173
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

---

## 🌐 Example 2: React (Vite) — With Nginx

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 - Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2 - Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

## 🔥 Example 3: Angular — With Nginx

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 - Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --prod

# Stage 2 - Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist/my-angular-app /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

## 🌈 Example 4: Vue.js — With Nginx

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

## 🌀 Example 5: Next.js (SSR)

> Note: Next.js apps are usually **not static builds**, but server-side rendered.

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

## 🧱 Example 6: Static HTML Website

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

| Nginx Config Path       | `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`      |

## 🧠 As a DevOps Engineer, Key Things to Remember

1. **Always use multi-stage builds** → keeps image size small.
2. **Use alpine-based images** for lightweight containers.
3. **Avoid copying node_modules** from local → build inside container.
4. **Expose correct port** (React dev = 5173, Angular = 4200, Next.js = 3000).
5. **Static apps** (React, Vue, Angular) → serve with Nginx.
6. **SSR apps** (Next.js, Nuxt.js) → run with Node directly.
7. **Custom Nginx config** if you use routing (e.g., React Router).

Would you like me to give **all these Dockerfiles together in one folder structure (frontend-dockerfiles)** — like a ready-to-use reference project (React, Angular, Vue, Next, etc.)?
That way you can keep it as your personal DevOps template set.
